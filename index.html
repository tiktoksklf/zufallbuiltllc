            I strongly recommend avoiding this business.

    <h2>My Experience &amp; Why I Recommend Avoiding This Business</h2>

    <p class="value" style="line-height:1.7; color:#e6e6e6;">
        <strong>ZufallBuilt Racecars &amp; Decals LLC, located in Spring Hill, Florida</strong>, worked on my BMW after I brought it in for a <strong>downpipe installation</strong>. Initially, everything seemed fine, but <strong>shortly after the downpipe was installed, issues began to appear</strong>.

        <br><br>

        From that point on, <strong>I was at his shop nearly every week</strong>. Almost every time I picked the car up, <strong>I noticed something new was wrong</strong>. <strong>Belts failed, pulleys went bad, gaskets leaked, and eventually the oil pan and oil pump failed</strong> — all within a span of about <strong>two months of repeatedly taking my car to his shop</strong>. On multiple occasions, <strong>he would mention a part on my car, and within days — sometimes even the same day — that exact part would fail</strong>. If I was lucky, it might last a few days, <strong>but most did not</strong>.

        <br><br>

        <strong>The final straw</strong> was when my turbos supposedly <strong>“went out” while the car was in his driveway</strong>. There were <strong>no oil puddles, no prior turbo issues, and no warning signs</strong>. The failure happened <strong>immediately after he had been working around the turbos</strong> and as I was leaving for <strong>yet another repair</strong>.

        <br><br>

        After the turbo incident, <strong>I took the car to a BMW-specialized mechanic</strong>. They inspected the vehicle and found that <strong>many of the parts installed were old, used, crusty, and improperly installed</strong>. Unfortunately, <strong>I spent a little over $20,000 in repairs</strong> over this period, only to discover that <strong>the work performed was substandard</strong>.

        <br><br>

        Looking back, <strong>I allowed myself to be gaslit by this mechanic for months</strong>, trusting his explanations while <strong>my car continued to deteriorate under his care</strong>.
